      <p>IETF YANG-Push, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8639">RFC 8639</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8641">RFC 8641</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9196">RFC 9196</a> establishes an interoparable standard among YANG-Push publisher and receiver implementations for subscription and notification capability negotiation and subscription configuration and notification schema. Reducing the operators burden of maintaining multiple YANG data collections and transformations and enabling automated subscription deployment and transformation.</p>
	  
	  <p>YANG-Push to Message Broker Integration Architecture, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration">draft-ietf-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration</a>, makes YANG notifications and YANG schema natively consumable in a Data Mesh enviroment. Enabling interoparable YANG integration into network observability real-time streaming applications.</p>
	  
	  <p>This website aims to help YANG-Push implementors and operators by giving an overview on different standard documents and their features, in which minimal viable product which features are available, which minimal viable product has been implemented in which network operating systems and how they can be deployed the easiest in a network operator data mesh enviroment.</p>

    <h3><a href="latest-news.html">Latest News</a></h3>
    <p>Some parts of the YANG-Push specifications are still under development at IETF <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/netconf/about/">NETCONF</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/nmop/about/">NMOP</a>. In order to keep the implementors and operators up to date, regularly updates, changes are being summarized. Helping to keep track how the specification and implementations are changing and give guidance how you can get involved in the discussions.</p>

    <h3><a href="how-to-implement.html">How To Implement</a></h3>
    <p>There are several documents from IETF <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/netconf/about/">NETCONF</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/nmop/about/">NMOP</a> working groups to be considered for implementation. In an agile incremental driven development fashion, features from these documents are being categorized in releases to help the implementor to align with the operators needs. In MVP 1 release the focus is to establish a working data processing pipeline. While in MVP 2, features which help to scale and secure are being introduced. And in MVP 3, features to optimize, further scale, are being added.</p>
